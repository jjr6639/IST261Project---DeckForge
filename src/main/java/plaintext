HashMap:
I chose HashMap for its O(1) average time complexity which is good for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
It's suited for managing a collection of decks where each deck has a unique identifier.
By using HashMap, this will ensure that efficient performance is achieved as the collection grows and makes searching for specific decks much faster compared to linear structures.
The encapsulating class will be DeckManager.
