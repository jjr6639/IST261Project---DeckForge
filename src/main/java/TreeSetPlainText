For the second collections implementation for my project, I am using TreeSet<Card> to handle the collection of cards within each of the user's decks. The main advantage of this,
Is that TreeSet will automatically handle and sort the cards based on their ordering,
which is defined using a compareTo() method. So, pretty much, that means when the cards
are added to the deck, they will be automatically stored in a sorted order. eliminating
the use for manual sorting. TreeSet also makes sure that there is no duplicate cards added in each deck.
